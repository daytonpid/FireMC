 This is FireMC, a motion controller for RepRap 3D printers and Factory Robots like FirePick delta and others. FireMC is currently implemented as an Arduino Due add-on board. FireMC features:
- 12-30V input
- Separate heatbed input
- 12v 1.5A switching regulator for 12v peripherals (if input is not 12v)
- 7 pwm channels (1 heatbed, 3 high power, 1 med power and 2 channels connected to the 12v rail)
- Sockets for 6 stepper drivers
- micro-sd socket
- WiFi via esp8266 module
- 5 thermistor inputs
- 7 limit switch inputs
- 4 io's which can be used for thermocouple inputs and/or servos
- 2 expansion headers for LCD or other peripherals
