- Input caps SMPS need 1206 footprint
- R42 should not be 4K7 (probably 470R-1K)
- Some motor connectors are too close to 100uF caps
- Need a smaller inductor for SMPS
- Print info on silkscreen (jumper locations, stepper name, stepper orientation, connector name/function/polarity)
- Via's in power tracks should be bigger (or multiple via's)
