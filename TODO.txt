+ Input caps SMPS need 1206 footprint
+ R42 should not be 4K7 (probably 470R-1K)
+ Some motor connectors are too close to 100uF caps
+ Need a smaller inductor for SMPS
- Print info on silkscreen 
	+ jumper locations
	+ stepper name
	- stepper orientation
	+ connector name/function/polarity
+ Via's in power tracks should be bigger (or multiple via's)
+ Check if SMPS is working/what is wrong
+ check what we have on d13 - has arduino led on it
- See if it's useful to connect more IO's of the esp8266 to the arduino
+ Check if we can have hardware PWM on some (all?) of the pwm outputs (pwm outputs are d2-d13) -> We now have all except LP-FET2 on pwm outputs
+ Don't use tx0 and rx0, they are connected to the atmega 16u2
+ pin 20 and 21 (sda and scl) have 1k5 pull-ups: check what's connected to them! -> Now: eeprom
+ is the led on a high-current pin? -> No. Is on the same pin as arduino led
+ Add header for I2C (sda, scl and gnd)
- Add 5v, GND, SIG for Karl
