+ Input caps SMPS need 1206 footprint
+ R42 should not be 4K7 (probably 470R-1K)
+ Some motor connectors are too close to 100uF caps
+ Need a smaller inductor for SMPS
- Print info on silkscreen 
	+ jumper locations
	+ stepper name
	- stepper orientation
	+ connector name/function/polarity
+ Via's in power tracks should be bigger (or multiple via's)
+ Check if SMPS is working/what is wrong
+ check what we have on d13 - has arduino led on it
- See if it's useful to connect more IO's of the esp8266 to the arduino
